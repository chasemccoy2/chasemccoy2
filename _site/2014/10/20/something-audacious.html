	<p>For a while now, I have wanted to stop writing at <a href="http://kyledreger.com">kyledreger.com</a>.</p>

<p>I love writing, and I think it helps me work through my own thoughts. However, I have always wanted to write in a place that didn’t scream “me.” I wanted a place where I could grow the brand beyond myself.</p>

<p>Some thoughts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>This is the web column I want to read. It will feature articles and musings at the intersection of art and technology.</li>
  <li>I want this site to be profitable, which won’t take too much. However, goals are good, and I want this site to be in the black, <em>within</em> a year.</li>
  <li>I love reader feedback, and I strongly encourage you to send me any of your thoughts (or counter arguments) with the <a href="/about">email on this page</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>As always, thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy this new space. I sure do.</p>
