<blockquote>
  The double-story “a” has been changed to a single-story. The “o”s and “e” are rounder, and the “b” has a more traditional stem. In essence, this is a perfectly acceptable wordmark, a kind of twenty-first-century Franklin Gothic for the millennial generation. It has a great rhythm, it’s perfectly crafted — although the left part of the “e” seems a tad heavy — and it’s very nicely kerned. The problem is that, for lack of a better thought, it does not compute.

In this podcast from CGP Grey and Brady Haran, entitled <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGa3ah03uBI">Being Wrong on the Internet</a></em>, you get an idea of what goes in to handcrafting a beautiful piece of well researched Internet.

<blockquote>
  There’s more to being a pro than just playing tennis. The more successful you are, the more people will want out of you. It won’t always be something you’ll want to do, and it won’t always be fun. The pressure will be as exhausting as anything you’ll ever do on the tennis court. But as a tennis champion, you have that responsibility. You play tennis because you love the game, not because you love the limelight, so get ready. Think about getting some media training. It’ll go a long way. Luckily, you’ll be out of the game before these things called Twitter and Facebook come around. Be thankful for that. One day you’ll understand what I mean.

I don’t think Apple intended it to come off that way, but it did. That segment seemed as though Mr. Cook was trying to use Ms. Turlington as an example of <em>every</em> potential Apple Watch wearer: the athlete, the mother, the successful businesswoman, the donates-their-time person. I think Apple earnestly, and rightly, wanted to promote Ms. Turlington, but their execution felt forced.
