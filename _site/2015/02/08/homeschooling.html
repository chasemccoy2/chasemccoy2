Jason Tanz, writing for Wired:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And yet, as I talked to more of these homeschoolers, I found it harder to dismiss what they were saying. My son is in kindergarten, and I fear that his natural curiosity won’t withstand 12 years of standardized tests, underfunded and overcrowded classrooms, and constant performance anxiety. The Internet has already overturned the way we connect with friends, meet potential paramours, buy and sell products, produce and consume media, and manufacture and deliver goods. Every one of those processes has become more intimate, more personal, and more meaningful. Maybe education can work the same way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>About 15 years removed, I attribute a lot of my own homeschooling success to the fact that my mother was a licensed teacher. Today, married to a high school teacher, I think the internet and tech can be used to great success for instruction, but I also feel that the experience will be made or broken, based on the quality of the instructor.</p>
