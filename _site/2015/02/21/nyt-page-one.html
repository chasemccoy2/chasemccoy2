<em>New York Times</em> Executive Editor Dean Baquet, in a memo to staff last week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These changes are intended to ensure that our digital platforms are much less tethered to print deadlines. We need to be posting more of our best stories not in the late evening, but when The Times’s digital readership is at its height:between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This new system will, in particular, give us more flexibility in targeting readers on mobile (which now receives more than half of our traffic) and on platforms like Facebook (where we are rolling out new strategies for presenting our journalism).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some background, from <a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/02/19/at-long-last-the-new-york-times-is-thinking-about-digital-first/">Matthew Ingram at Gigaom</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Page One meetings at the Grey Lady are somewhat legendary, both inside and <a href="http://www.takepart.com/pageone">outside the building</a> — seen by many as a kind of crucible in which the best Times journalism is forged, like the heavenly blacksmithing operation that the Greek god Hephaestus used to run up on Mount Olympus. Now, however, executive editor Dean Baquet says the morning news meeting will be devoted to pitches by the various section editors about which stories they think deserve to get the best play on the paper’s website.</p>
