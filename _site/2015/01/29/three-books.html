	<p>I recently had the opportunity to pick up three books that I had been meaning to buy. I’ve rented and borrowed copies of these titles before, but I’m happy to finally own them for myself:</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.com/081296389X"><em>The New York Times Manual of Style</em></a> — If you’re trying to do serious blogging, you should be keeping a personal style guide. Style guides are incredibly useful because they help keep your writing consistent. It doesn’t matter if you like the serial comma or if you spell website as two words, just make your <a href="/style-guide">editorial decisions consistent</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.com/020530902X"><em>The Elements of Style, by Strunk and White</em></a> — This book offers a wide variety of practical and technical tips on writing and grammar. I’ve seen this title referenced plenty of times throughout my college writing days, and, as a writer, I’m almost a little embarrassed that it has taken this long for me to obtain my own copy.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0131103628"><em>The C Programming Language, by Kernighan and Ritchie</em></a> — What <em>The Elements of Style</em> is to writing, <em>The C Programming Language</em> is to programming. Kernighan and Ritchie’s book on the venerable C language is legendary for it’s pragmatic approach to programming. In addition to being a great reference, this book will also help me to acquaint myself with the “low level” technology stack, the fundamental base that powers most, if not all, computing devices.</p>
