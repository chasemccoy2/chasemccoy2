	<p><a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2015/01/open-and-shut/">Where Blanket Statements about Workplace Environments Are Contested</a> — 
 First, the Washington Post wrote that “Google got it wrong. The open-office trend is destroying the workplace.” Then, veteran manager, Michael Lopp, <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/your-best-work/">responded</a>, and then, it seemed, everyone who has ever worked in an office weighed in. This piece by Dr. Drang summed things up nicely, and catching the tail end of the discussion gives us a nice chain to walk back up for context. I agree with much of what Dr. Drang wrote, even if I did cringed a bit as the distinction between “real engineers” and software engineers was pointed out; even calling software engineers “special snowflakes.” Oddly vitriolic.</p>
