	<p>The latest essay from The Players’ Tribune is sublime. Pete Sampras’ <a href="http://www.theplayerstribune.com/pete-sampras-letter-to-my-younger-self/">letter to his younger self</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s more to being a pro than just playing tennis. The more successful you are, the more people will want out of you. It won’t always be something you’ll want to do, and it won’t always be fun. The pressure will be as exhausting as anything you’ll ever do on the tennis court. But as a tennis champion, you have that responsibility. You play tennis because you love the game, not because you love the limelight, so get ready. Think about getting some media training. It’ll go a long way. Luckily, you’ll be out of the game before these things called Twitter and Facebook come around. Be thankful for that. One day you’ll understand what I mean.</p>
