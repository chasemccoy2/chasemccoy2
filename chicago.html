<p>I spent 21 years growing up in a small town in Mississippi. Then, I moved to Chicago.
While it has been a big adjustment, I really do think that I was always meant to
be in a city like Chicago. I feel like I belong here. I live in the Wicker Park
neighborhood, and I love it. Here are some of my favorite spots in my neighborhood
and elsewhere.</p>
