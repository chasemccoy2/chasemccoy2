I’m currently working as a UX/UI designer at <a href="https://fr.bnbsitter.com/">Bnbsitter</a>. We’re a fast-growing Parisian startup with 25 employees in total and a design team of two, <a href="http://julieh.info/">Julie</a> and me. During our last funding round in May 2016 we raised 2.2 million euros that we’re using to expand by improving our services and releasing an app.
