I’m currently working as an iOS and web designer/developer (although I often find myself pushing my boundaries and learning new things) at [NSPARC](https://www.nsparc.msstate.edu). I work with a fantastic team of developers, and I try my best to enable them to make the best stuff possible through effective design. We make iOS, Android, and web applications for many clients such as the [Mississippi Department of Employment Security](http://wings.mdes.ms.gov), [Department of Child Protection Services](https://mdcps.ms.gov), and [Department of Human Services](https://my.mdhs.ms.gov).
