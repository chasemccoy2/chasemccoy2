<div class="bio">Hi, I’m Chase. It’s super nice to meet you. This site
	was made to showcase some of the things that make me who I am. In short,
	I am a developer and designer who works on the internet (and mobile too).
	On a broader scale, I am a hoplessly wistful artist trying to find a
	way to contribute to the world while taking care of my mental health.
	I'm from the south, I live in Chicago, and I really have no clue what
	I'm doing. It's spectacular.

<h1 class="intro">
	If you have some time, I have some things I would really like to share with you.
