If you asked me what I considered to be essential reading for a designer (especially one who works om the web), most of that list would be stuff by Frank Chimero. Here are my favorites of his:

* [Designing in the Borderlands](http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/designing-in-the-borderlands/)
* [The Webâ€™s Grain](http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/the-webs-grain/)
* [What Screens Want](https://www.frankchimero.com/writing/what-screens-want/)
