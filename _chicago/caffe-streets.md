I love a good coffee shop. When I was choosing a neighborhood to live in before moving to Chicago, one of the factors I took into consideration was proximity to good coffee. Caffe Streets is less than a block from my apartment and they make a great cup. Outdoor seating, free WiFi, and and a cozy environment make this one of my favorite spots to work from or just to grab a coffee and people watch.
