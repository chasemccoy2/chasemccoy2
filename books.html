<p>These are the books that have shaped who I am as a person, designer, and developer.
One of the best ways to become a better designer is to read the work of those who came
before, and a lot of these changed the way I approach design. Some will make you cry,
some will make you laugh, some you'll think are pretty dumb.</p>
