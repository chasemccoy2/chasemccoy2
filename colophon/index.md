The Owlery is written, curated, and published by Chase McCoy.

Chase is a full-time student and iOS developer/designer studying Computer Science at Mississippi State University.

He is also the cofounder of [Cosmic Owl Studio](http://cosmicowl.co), where he makes apps with his best friend. 

## Tools

The Owlery is hosted on GitHub Pages and is generated with Jekyll. 

Posts are written using Editorial on iOS and Whiskey on the Mac. I use an iPhone 6s and a 13’’ MacBook Pro to write, design, and make apps.

## Miscellany 

The Owlery uses Bridone Titling for headlines, and a combination of Avenir Next and San Francisco for the body text.
