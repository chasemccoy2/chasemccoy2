<p>Music is just about the most important thing in my life. I listen to it constantly,
relate to it daily, and wouldn't want to live without it. I think the best poetry
out there is hidden in music. Here are some of my favorite albums. Some of these
have are emotionally significant for me, and some are just fun.</p>
