I am super excited to announce my latest venture, and newest project. Me and my friend [Nathan Ansel][1] have started a design and development studio called [Cosmic Owl][2]. Today, we are launching our first app.

[Nox][3] is a super simple, super fast app for finding when the sun will set and rise at your current location. Nox keeps track of your location in the background, and calculates the sunset and sunrise times algorithmically. That means no internet connection is required.

The app also features a notification center widget, and it allows you to get customizable alerts before the sunset and sunrise. If that sounds useful to you, I think you will really love Nox.

The app is $0.99, and it&#8217;s available today. [Check it out in the App Store][3].
