Back again with their summer release, Field Notes has released the [&#8220;Arts and Sciences edition&#8221;][1]. There are two big things that set this set apart from the previous editions:

  1. The books are larger. Instead of the traditional 3.5˝ by 5.5˝ memo books, these new ones are 7.5˝ by 4.75˝. I really love this size. I love the smaller size as well, but sometimes I just need something a little bigger.</p> 
  2. The &#8220;arts&#8221; book features lined paper, and the &#8220;science&#8221; book has graph paper. The best part, though, is that the right side has the lines or graph, and the left side is always blank. I love this idea. Sometimes you need structure, and sometimes you need a blank canvas.

In addition, these books feature a lovely wine and slate gray colored covers with a lot of great information printed inside of them. I cannot wait to receive mine in the mail.
