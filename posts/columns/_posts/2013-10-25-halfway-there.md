Creativity is defined by my Mac as &#8220;the use of the imagination or original ideas, esp. in the production of an artistic work.&#8221;

Being creative is one thing, but using our creativity to produce work that we can be proud of is an entirely different beast. Anyone who writes, designs, produces, develops, etc., knows how hard it can be to make something. Gaining success from the things that you spend so much time and effort making can be even harder.

Success comes and goes, but if we want our work to be worth doing the effort we put into it must be constant. You cannot fake effort. You have to work hard to get what you want.

Shawn Blanc [made a chart][1] outlining what he considers to be the elements of a successful creative business. I strongly encourage you to read his entire article. He says that 75% of your effort should be devoted to the content. That 75% is split up evenly into consistency, talent, and obsession.

Shawn has some good news for those of us to strive for creative success:

> Good news, if you can at least show up every day and focus on a topic your obsessive about, then youâ€™re already half-way there. 

The point that I took away from Shawn&#8217;s article is that it takes a lot to be successful. Time, skill, and motivation are required if you want to triumph. However, there is hope for those of us who don&#8217;t have as much time to dedicate to their passion as they would like. There is hope for those who&#8217;s skills are not as evolved as they would like. And there is hope for those who lose their motivation from time to time.

No one is perfect, and success can certainly come to those of us who struggle with some elements of our work. As long as we can get halfway there, there is no reason to believe that we can&#8217;t be successful.
