Have you ever been talking to someone or reading something on the web and realized after the fact that you have no idea what you just heard or read? Or perhaps you leave a room and try to remember some detail about it, only to come to no conclusion because you did not observe the room. The dictionary defines &#8216;observe&#8217; as &#8220;notice or perceive (something) and register it as being significant&#8221;. The latter part of that definition is really what is important here.

You may have looked at that room you were in. You may have noticed it, or even perceived it. But did it register for you? Often times it is hard to find the significance of the things we see and experience.

I believe that by learning to observe and register the things in out life in a more concrete manner, we could increase our thoughtfulness and our ability in creative matters. Inspiration is all around us if we just take the time to register the significance and dedicate our time and attention to it. This can take great patience, but the mental energy sacrificed will be rewarded.

There is a law of physics that says that energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only change forms. Why couldn&#8217;t we also apply this to mental and creative energy?

We may feel as though our inspiration has been destroyed at times, but by observing our thoughts and surroundings we can discover that it has merely changed forms into something completely unexpected.
