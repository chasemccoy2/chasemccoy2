[Everpix][1] was a service that me and many other people loved. The app allowed you to sync all of your photos to the cloud and view them anywhere. Yesterday, [Everpix announced][2] that they were shutting down.

I am sad that Everpix is going away. It was a great way to have access to your photos anywhere, and its automatic organization was really useful. But the more I think about it, the more obvious it seems to me that Everpix never stood a chance on its own.

The app’s business model was simple: a free account let you view your photos from the last twelve months, and a $50/year paid account let you upload **all** of your photos. That price is awesome for users, but most users have tons of photos. Storing potential terabytes of data for $50 a year is simply not sustainable.

Sure enough, [in an article that The Verge wrote][3] about the shut down, they have this to say:

> The immediate concern in the room was a forthcoming bill from Amazon Web Services, which hosts the 400 million photos stored with Everpix; the team estimated the bill would be about $35,000.

Everpix just didn’t have enough funds to pay their bills, and that is really sad. 

The best thing that Everpix could have done was to sell the company to someone like Apple or Dropbox, and they did try. For whatever reason, none of their deals worked out. Although [apparently they did sell their technology to someone][4].

I am going to miss Everpix. There are some alternatives out there, but nothing as full-featured and well-established. Digital photo management is a sorely underdeveloped market, and Everpix was doing more than anyone to change that. 

If you are an Everpix user, you can expect a full refund of your subscription and a chance to download all of your photos in the coming weeks.
