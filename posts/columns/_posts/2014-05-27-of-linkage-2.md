A few years ago [I wrote a post][1] with links to some cool OmniFocus resources. With the recent launch of OmniFocus 2.0 for the Mac, I thought it would be appropriate to share a few more that I have found handy.

If you have any other interesting OmniFocus links, send them my way and I will add them to the list.

  * [Inside OmniFocus][2] – The OmniGroup has put this site together to feature the workflows of some prominent OmniFocus users. I really enjoyed reading all of the workflow stories. They also have some handy tools and services for using OmniFocus at the end. This site will be updated with new content from time to time, so be sure to keep and eye on it.</p> 
  * [Perspective icons by Josh Hughes][3] – Every great custom perspective needs a great icon. Josh has made a lot of icons that come in many different colors and retina versions. The best part about these is that they fit in with the default OmniFocus icons very well.</p> 
  * [OmniFocus for Mac condensed view][4] – In a post on the Omni forums, CEO Ken Case wrote about a hidden setting in version 2 of the app that allows you to enable a condensed view. A lot of the complaints around OmniFocus 2 for the Mac has been about the data density being too low and the check circles being on the right. This view places the check circles on the left and increases the density. I don’t like how small the check circles are in this view, but a lot of people love this alternate layout.

  * [OmniFocus 2.0 for Mac user manual][5] (iTunes link) – If you need some help using the new app, the OmniGroup has a user manual available for free on the iBooks Store.

  * [Free OmniFocus for Mac 2.0 screencast][6] – Don McAllister of ScreenCastsOnline has made a free video available that explains the basics of using the new app. This is a great way to familiarize yourself with OmniFocus for Mac.

  * Bonus – If you use [Keyboard Maestro][7] on the Mac (if not, you should be), you can download the macros that I have created to help me send Safari tabs to OmniFocus. I have two different macros. One of them send the current tab in Safari to the OmniFocus clipper. The second creates a new task in the clipper, and puts links to every open tab in OmniFocus in the note field of the task. I have been using these scripts for a long time to help me save links for later. I am sure that the scripts in these macros came from someone on the internet, but it has been so long that I cannot remember where I got them from. So, whoever it was that wrote these, thank you! If you are interested, you can download the macros below.
    
    [Send single tab to OmniFocus clipper][8].  
    [Send all tabs to OmniFocus clipper][9].

Hopefully you’ll find some of these links interesting. There are so many people out there that use and love OmniFocus. It’s great to have such a wealth of resources available to improve an already great suite of apps.
