Nox was the first iOS app that I developed and released to the App Store. It is a simple sunset/sunrise countdown app that has a beautiful design, requires no internet connection, and has customizable reminders. I am very proud of the icon for the app. I remember designing about 50 different icons, and this is the one that stuck.
