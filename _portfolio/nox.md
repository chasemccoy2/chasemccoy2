[Nox](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/nox-sunset-and-sunrise-times/id998183834?mt=8&at=1010l5Ku) was the first iOS app that I developed and released to the App Store. It is a simple sunset/sunrise countdown app that has a beautiful design, requires no internet connection, and has customizable reminders. I am very proud of the icon for the app. I remember designing about 50 different icons, and this is the one that stuck.
