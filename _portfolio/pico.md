I worked with designer [Louie Mantia](http://louiemantia.com) to develop a camera app that brings what we love about analog film to digital cameras. That app is [Pico Digital Film](http://pico.film). Now you can select a film and shoot your photos however you see the world, not just how the camera sees the world. Pico provides eight different film selections.  If you're shooting vibrant objects, you'll want to use MAX, Ultra, or Plus. Warm color objects like food will look great with Gold, while cool color objects like a winter scene will look better with Xtra. And if you're shooting a moody black and white scene, try Noir. A black and white portrait? Try One. But if you just want to relive fond memories of instant film, XPro will take you there.
