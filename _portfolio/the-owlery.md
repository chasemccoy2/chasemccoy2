[The Owlery](http://theowlery.co) is my personal home on the web. I like to describe it as a hyperlink odyssey, or my little wunderkammer of digital *stuff*. It's here that I share my writing and photography, and curate the most interesting links and quotes I find as I surf the world wide web. Most blogs are lists of content, but I designed The Owlery to read like the front page of a newspaper. I wanted an experience that was tailored to several types of content, and you will find that it is split up between my column, a running list of shorter posts that I call asides, and an interesting quote or two. These sections are made to be browsed and enjoyed, not just to take in the latest post and move on.
