title: The New NetNewsWire
excerpt: I remember when RSS was a big deal.

I remember when RSS was a big deal. When subscribing to your favorite sites was a joy, and everyone got their news from their favorite RSS reader. Then Google Reader shut down, and Twitter came along, and now RSS isn’t what it used to be.

Back in the golden days of RSS, though, NetNewsWire was *the* RSS app of choice. [Today, NetNewsWire is returning with a new version for Mac and iPhone](http://netnewswireapp.com/) (no iPad). Plus, [a new cloud syncing service](http://netnewswireapp.com/cloudsync/) to keep your subscriptions and unread states in sync between your devices. 

If you use RSS, you should give NetNewsWire a shot. If you don’t use RSS, download them and subscribe to a few sites. I bet you you won’t regret it.
