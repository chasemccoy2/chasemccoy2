I really loved [this article in the Houston Press about the danger of opinions and beliefs formed based on misinformation][1]. Too often I see people who think that their opinion is valid simply because they believe it.

> In other words, you can form an opinion in a bubble, and for the first couple of decades of our lives we all do. However, eventually you are going to venture out into the world and find that what you thought was an informed opinion was actually just a tiny thought based on little data and your feelings. Many, many, many of your opinions will turn out to be uninformed or just flat out wrong. No, the fact that you believed it doesn’t make it any more valid or worthwhile, and nobody owes your viewpoint any respect simply because it is yours. 

It’s even more dangerous when those people spread the misinformation to others who believe it simply because it’s there. It’s the reason I avoid Facebook as much as I do.
