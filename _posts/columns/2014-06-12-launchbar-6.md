Yesterday, Objective Development released [version 6.0 of LaunchBar][1]. For those who don&#8217;t know, LaunchBar is a fantastic application for the Mac that lets you launch apps and actions using your keyboard.

I have been testing LaunchBar 6 for several months and I really love it. I was previously an [Alfred][2] user, but while testing LaunchBar 6 I found that I enjoy it a lot more. I think that LaunchBar comes set up out of the box for more advanced features, and I love its instant send feature.

Every Mac user can make use an app like LaunchBar of Alfred. I highly encourage you to download LaunchBar 6 and give it a try. Also, be sure to read [Shawn Blanc&#8217;s excellent review of the app and history of application launchers][3].
