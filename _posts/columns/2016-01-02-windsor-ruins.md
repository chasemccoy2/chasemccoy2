I live in Mississippi, which has its upsides and downsides when it comes to photographic opportunities. On one hand, there are lots of beautiful things to photograph. On the other, most of those things are all really similar.

One landmark in MS that I have always wanted to visit and photograph are the Windsor Ruins in Port Gibson. Wikipedia [sums up this landmark pretty well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Ruins):

> The ruins consist of 23 standing Corinthian columns of the largest antebellum Greek Revival mansion ever built in the state. The mansion stood from 1861 to 1890, when it was destroyed by fire.

This past October, a friend and I decided to make the 4 hour trip to the ruins to take photos. We of course stopped at many placed along the way to document our trip.

Here is a lovely sunken path we found exploring the woods around Port Gibson:

The leaves had just begun to change colors when we made this trip, which made for a lovely combination of oranges, yellows, and greens in the photos.

We stumbled upon a dilapidated house on the way and I managed to get this spooky shot. I didn’t expect this to turn out very well but in the end I think it’s a very interesting photo:

When we arrived at the ruins we were glad to find that we were the only ones there that day. It was also raining quite a bit, but it stopped right when we arrived. This gave us a great moody, wet environment to take photos.

The columns were extremely difficult to capture in one photo. They are extremely tall and so surreal standing all alone in the middle on nowhere.

If you ever come through Mississippi I highly recommend you stop by the Windsor Ruins. They are a lovely landmark of a past era, and they are not far off the Natchez Trace, which has many beautiful sights.
