> No one is making a bad camera or a bad lens or a bad light or a bad camera bag or a bad sensor. For years (yes, years) the sensors have been incredible. Too much noise at a high ISO level? Oh well, bring it into Adobe Lightroom and no one will bitch about it unless they like looking at an image at 100% all the time. But those people never go on to become better photographers and only worry about looking at lab tests all day and night. Now, more than any other time in history, it is possible for you to create a better image.

Photography is quickly becoming one of my favorite hobbies. When I bought my first mirrorless camera I set out to learn as much as I could about the technical aspects of photography. Knowledge of things like aperature, shutter speed, and ISO were what I believed made good photographers great. Boy, was I mistaken.

Nowadays, I struggle not with the gear, but with the deeper part of photography. How do I capture emotion? How do I tell a story with a single image? There are no online resources that teach these things.

I love Chris’ piece because he’s right—it doesn’t matter what gear you use. A good photographer can capture something significant with just about any camera.

I don’t think I’m there yet. But every time I take a photo I try to stop and ask myself 1) what it is that I am trying to capture and 2) why I want to capture it. By doing this, I can better understand what separates the good photos from the bad.
