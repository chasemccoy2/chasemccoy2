Marco Arment has just released [his new podcast app for iPhone and the web, Overcast][1]. I have only used Overcast for a little bit, but it is already my favorite podcast app. Marco has a talent for making really great apps and services, and Overcast is a good example of that. For specifics, be sure to [check out Marco&#8217;s article][2]. [Federico Viticci also has a review and interview with Marco][3] about the app.

As far as my review goes, I think that this is my favorite part of the app:

![Overcast][4]

Marco is one classy dude.
